# Githubby

A Flutter application for viewing a rich feed of GitHub activity.

An idea inspired by https://github.com/GroovinChip/GitHub-Activity-Feed

## Getting Started

1) Create a personal access token on GitHub
2) Create a `data.env` file in the root of the project. Add a value called `GH_SECRET_KEY` and set it equal to your personal access token:
  ```
  GH_SECRET_KEY=your_token_here
  ```
